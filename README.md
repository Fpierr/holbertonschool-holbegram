Welcome to the final Flutter project!  
This application is built with Flutter, a high-performance cross-platform framework that allows us to develop a single mobile app for both Android and iOS using Dart.  
Let’s begin this exciting journey.

## Requirements
#### Create your project :

Open you’re command-line tool

- `flutter create holbegram`
- `cd holbegram`
- `flutter run`

#### Step up your Firebase

For the backend, we are going to use Firebase, Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) app development platform that provides hosted backend services such as (`a real-time database`, `cloud storage`, `authentication`, `crash reporting`, `machine learning`, `remote configuration`) and hosting for your static files. However, for storing and managing images, we will use Cloudinary, which is a cloud service that provides an easy-to-use solution for managing images and videos, including features for storing, transforming, and delivering media content. Cloudinary will handle the storage and retrieval of image files, while Firebase will handle the authentication and database functionalities.

Let’s start…

go to `https://firebase.google.com/` and create an account then Let’s create a new project in firebase.

Go to Firebase Console and click Add Project and then you have to go through some steps.
